# Rbsyn

Program synthesis for Ruby

Uses RDL to do type directed synthesis of Ruby programs.

## Using Rbsyn

Use `bundle install` to install the dependencies. You can run all the unit tests and benchmarks by running:

```
bundle exec rake
```

All tests go in `test/*_test.rb` and synthesis examples go in `test/*_benchmark.rb`.
